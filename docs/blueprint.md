# **App Name**: Liquid Visor

## Core Features:

- Glass Overlay: Create a translucent overlay effect to simulate a 'liquid glass' appearance.
- Code Embed: Dynamically embed the page's own HTML code snippet into the background.
- Code Visibility: Provide user controls to enable or disable the code in the background.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices for a consistent visual experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grey-blue (#A7B0C1) for a clean glass look, influenced by typical window-glass tinting.
- Background color: Very light grey-blue (#F2F4F7) a subtle desaturation of the primary color, maintaining brightness appropriate to a light scheme.
- Accent color: Slightly darker, muted blue-grey (#748499), shifted towards green from the primary hue to provide depth and avoid sterile neutrality.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying the embedded HTML code in the background.
- Elements should have blurred edges, where appropriate.
- Animate code in background. Perhaps it could automatically 'write' the page source at a speed appropriate to readability.
